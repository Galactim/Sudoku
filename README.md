A modern, API-based Sudoku app.

## Introduction

Our goal is to make the best Sudoku app on the web.

There are a lot of Sudoku games on the web, but none of them well built nor with good design.
We want to make our take modern, secure, well-designed and open to everyone – it works well on all available platforms and screens.

`Sudoku` consists of a public API, web app, and in the future – a mobile app.
